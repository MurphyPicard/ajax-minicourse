This is a project I built with assistance of Udacity.
It's nice to go through tutorials like this and visually see results.

The purpose is to practice using APIs in 3 ways.

Google Maps I'm just getting the right url and plugging it into an 'a' tag.

NY times I needed to get a key.

Wikipedia didn't need a key but I needed to use jsonp or cors.  I used jsonp.
